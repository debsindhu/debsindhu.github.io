### **My history**

* ### **_Childhood_**   
 I was born in Tamluk. If you do not know about _Tamluk_ that is fine. Here is quick read about [Tamluk from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamluk). They say my hometown is atleast about _5150 years old_. I grew up beside the banks of river _Rupnarayana_. The bay of Bengal is not that far from my home. When I was in my school I developed quite a interest in _History_ - especially ancient time histories - they still fascinate me. Towards the end of my high school I got attracted to Physics. 

* ### **_University days_**   
 This is when I thought I would return to history soon but let's learn some Physics first. So I went to study Physics in university. I completed the Bachelors' & Masters' degree from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) in Kolkata. During this time the _atomic scale_ Physics became my most intersting domain. So I went to [Laboratoire Léon Brillouin (LLB)](http://www-llb.cea.fr/) & [Université Pierre et Marie Curie(UPMC)](http://www.upmc.fr/en/), Paris for persuing my doctoral degree. I received the CFR grant for my doctoral work from [CEA](http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en). This is where I learned about the scattering techniques & the Molecular Dynamics simulation. The time that I spent in Paris during my Ph.D days was extraordinary in every sense. As I was nearing the end of my Ph.D I could sense I wanted more. 

* ### **_Post-Ph.D_**   
 So I decided to continue as Postdoc - 

*   #### **_San Sebastian_**   
  I landed up in [Donostia International Physics Center](http://dipc.ehu.es/index.php?lng=eng), Spain. This is in [San Sebastián](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n). By the way if you have not visited San Sebastián please do not delay. I lived here for couple of years before joining the [Wayne State University](https://wayne.edu/), USA. 

*   #### **_Wayne State_**   
  From this time at [Wayne State University](https://wayne.edu/) Biological problems became interesting to me. It was almost two years here before I got an offer from [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/), USA. The kind of stuffs I used to do during then - scattering experiments & computation for complex system - the ORNL is undoubtedly the unique place because of its neutron sources ([SNS](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) & [HFIR](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/hfir)) & [Supercomputer](https://www.ornl.gov/directorate/ccsd).    
  
*   #### **_Oak Ridge_**     
  I ended up joining ORNL towards end of spring 2016. In Fall 2017 they offered me staff scientist position that I humbly accepted. Since then I am here. I have now involved myself more into Data Analytics & started developing Machine Learning, Deep Learning tools for complex biological system to complement the scattering experiments & computation requirements. Apart from my research I like reading - primarily economics & politics, new discoveries & historical documents.
