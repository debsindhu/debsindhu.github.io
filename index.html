Debsindhu Bhowmik is an expert in AI technologies especially focusing on the domain of quantitative biophysics for integrative molecular approach. 
    He is presently working as Computational Scientist in Computational Sciences & Engineering Division and Health Data Sciences Institute 
    at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 

<p>His current work lies on the interface of implementing Deep Learning (DL) techniques, 
    running multi-scale high performance accelerated simulations and performing scattering experiments 
    (especially neutron and X-Ray) for problems related to soft matter systems especially Biomedical and biological sciences, 
    and to make new drug molecules with desired properties. The broader goal is to find how the DL techniques can be 
    optimally applied to the multi-scale modeling and simulation coupled with experiments to understand the underneath 
    physics of bio(macro)molecular function, activity, folding, microscopic structure and dynamic behavior at different 
    length and time scale and whether that knowledge could lead to designing new therapeutics. Additionally, 
    he is trying to develop tools to study large-scale datasets by learning the inherent hidden features of 
    biomolecules in order to reduce the need for running expensive computation or experiments. He has 
    authored over 50 papers including peer-reviewed journal publications and conference proceedings. His works 
    have been nominated for Gordon Bell prize, highlighted in popular Science magazines and featured in the US 
    Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (SC). </p> 
    
>!--I am Computational Scientist in Computational Sciences & Engineering Division and Health Data Sciences Institute-->
at <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>. I received my Bachelor's and Master's
in Physics from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/"> Jadavpur University</a> and Ph.D. from 
<a href="http://www.upmc.fr/en/">Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie</a> with CFR grant from
<a href="http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en">CEA</a>. Later I worked as Postdoctoral Researcher at
<a href="http://dipc.ehu.es/index.php?lng=eng">Donostia International Physics Center</a> and at
<a href="https://wayne.edu/">Wayne State University</a>. My current focus is in understanding of complex biological and
genetic phenomenon and studying disordered systems by implementing new generation large scale simulation blended
with Deep learning and scattering techniques.-->
