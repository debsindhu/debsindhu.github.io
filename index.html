Debsindhu Bhowmik is an <b>expert in AI technologies especially focusing on</b> the domain of <b>quantitative biophysics for integrative molecular 
    approach</b>. He is presently working as Computational Scientist in Computational Sciences & Engineering Division and Health Data Sciences 
    Institute at <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>. 

<p>His current work lies on the interface of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, 
    deplaoying multi-scale high performance accelerated simulations and performing scattering experiments 
    (especially neutron and X-Ray) for problems related to soft matter systems especially Biomedical and biological sciences, 
    and to make new drug molecules with desired properties.</p> 

<p>The broader goal is <i><strong>to find how the DL techniques can be optimally applied to the multi-scale modeling and 
    simulation coupled with experiments to understand the underneath physics of bio(macro)molecular function, activity, 
    folding, microscopic structure and dynamic behavior at different length and time scale and whether that knowledge 
    could lead to designing new therapeutics</i></strong>. Additionally, he is trying to develop AI tools to study 
    large-scale datasets by learning the inherent hidden features of biomolecules in order to reduce the need for 
    expensive computation or experiments.</p>  
    
<p>He has authored over 50 scholarly articles including peer-reviewed high impact journal publications and conference proceedings. His works 
    have been nominated for Gordon Bell prize, highlighted in popular Science magazines and featured in the US 
    Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (SC).</p>
