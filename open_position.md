### **Open Position with us**      

- **Postdoctoral Research Associate/ Post Masters/ Post Bachelors**:   

    * Working at ORNL is exciting and fun. We work here in many different projects that may or may not be inter-connected but most of the time (if not always) they are cutting-edge science. If you have experience in computation/ modelling/ simulation/ machine learning/ deep learning techniques and/ or have worked on physical chemistry/ chemical physics/ computational biology/ complex system/ soft matter/ Proteomics/ genomics or in related domain that would be advantegeous. But the most important requirement is to have the quality of working and thinking independently. So if you think you are up for the challenge please drop me an email with your CV & what you like to work on. We will proceed from there.
