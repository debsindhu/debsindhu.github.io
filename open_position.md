### **Open Position with us**      

- **Postdoctoral Research Associate/ Post Masters/ Post Bachelors**:   

    * Working at ORNL is exciting and fun. We work here in many different projects that may or may not be inter-connected but most of the time (if not always) they are cutting-edge science. If you have experience in computation/ modelling/ simulation/ machine learning/ deep learning techniques and/ or have worked on physical chemistry/ chemical physics/ computational biology/ complex system/ soft matter/ Proteomics/ genomics or in related domain that would be advantegeous. But the most important requirement is to have the quality of working and thinking independently. So if you think you are up for the challenge please drop me an email with your CV & what you like to work on. We will proceed from there.
    *  [postdoc position](https://lnkd.in/d6MXQSkq): Join Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the largest US Department of Energy (DOE) science and energy laboratory, and become part of groundbreaking research in energy and security. We are currently searching for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Associate to join our Multiscale Biomedical Systems Group in the Computational Sciences & Engineering Division. In this role, you will be at the forefront of cutting-edge computational science projects spanning biophysics, chemistry, and materials. Your main focus will be on developing and validating integrated computational models at the molecular, cellular, and tissue scales, incorporating genetic signatures. Collaborating with interdisciplinary researchers, esteemed scientists, and external partners, you will enhance your scientific profile and contribute to the key missions of the DOE Office of Science. With access to state-of-the-art resources and mentorship, you will have the opportunity to utilize your expertise in computational modeling and simulation, deep learning frameworks, programming languages, and high-performance computing. If you have a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset and are passionate about making a tangible impact in the biomedical field, this position provides an exceptional chance to advance your career and contribute to transformative solutions for pressing challenges. #postdocposition #modelingandsimulation #AI #deeplearning #hpc #moleculardynamics #ABM
