Please take a sneak peek on my research at [Projects](https://debsindhu.github.io/projects/) section.

* General Overview: My current work lies on the interface of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, deploying multi-scale high performance       accelerated simulations and performing scattering experiments (especially neutron and X-Ray) for problems related to 
    * *soft matter systems especially Biomedical and biological sciences*, and   
    * *making new drug molecules with desired properties*. 
* Broader Goal: 
    * **Optimal use of AI in integrative molecular approach:** to find how the AI techniques can be optimally applied to the multi-scale modeling and               simulation coupled with experiments 
    * **Deriving fundamental Physics:** to understand the underneath physics of bio(macro)molecular function, activity, folding, microscopic 
      structure and dynamic behavior at different length and time scale and whether that knowledge could lead to designing new therapeutics. 
    * **Reducing need for expensive computing and experiments by using AI:** Additionally, developing AI tools to study 
      large-scale datasets by learning the inherent hidden features of biomolecules in order to reduce the need for expensive computation or experiments.
