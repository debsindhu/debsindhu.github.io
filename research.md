* General Overview: His current work lies on the interface of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, deploying multi-scale high performance       accelerated simulations and performing scattering experiments (especially neutron and X-Ray) for problems related to 
    * soft matter systems especially Biomedical and biological sciences, and   
    * making new drug molecules with desired properties. 
* Broader Goal: 
    * Optimal use of AI in integrative molecular approach: to find how the AI techniques can be optimally applied to the multi-scale modeling and               simulation coupled with experiments 
    * Deriving fundamental Physics: to understand the underneath physics of bio(macro)molecular function, activity, folding, microscopic 
      structure and dynamic behavior at different length and time scale and whether that knowledge could lead to designing new therapeutics. 
    * Reducing need for expensive computing and experients through AI: Additionally, he is trying to develop AI tools to study 
      large-scale datasets by learning the inherent hidden features of biomolecules in order to reduce the need for expensive computation or experiments.
