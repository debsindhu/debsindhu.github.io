### **My Research**  

My current work primarily lies on the interface of implementing Deep Learning (DL) techniques, running Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulations and performing Scattering experiments (especially neutron and X-Ray) for problems related to Biomedical and 
biological sciences. The broader goal is to find how the DL techniques can be optimally applied to the MD simulation 
coupled with scattering experiments to understand the underneath physics of bio(macro)molecular function, activity, 
folding, microscopic structure and dynamic behavior at different length and time scale. Additionally taking advantage 
of various supervised and unsupervised DL algorithms, I am trying to develop tools to study large-scale datasets by 
learning the inherent hidden features of biomolecules in order to reduce the need for running expensive computation or 
experiments.
